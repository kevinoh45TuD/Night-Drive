Retro style racing game!

Project Overview : 

For my project I want to create a game similar to retro-racing games, except in 3D. 
My game will hopefully feature a procedurally generated track that will include some obstacles for the player to avoid. 
There will hopefully be some kind of music visualisation with the background scenery.
