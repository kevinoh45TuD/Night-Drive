# Project Title:    *"Night - Drive"*

Name:  Kevin O' Halloran

Student Number:   C18429952

Class Group:  DT508 / TU984 , GE1-2020-2021

# Description of the project

My original proposal: *"For my project I want to create a game similar to retro-racing games, except in 3D. 
My game will hopefully feature a procedurally generated track that will include some obstacles for the player to avoid. 
There will hopefully be some kind of music visualisation with the background scenery."*

My project is an endless runner inspired by retro-racing games such as *Outrun*. The track obstacles and scenery are prefabs randomly spawned so that
each playthrough feels unique. 

# Instructions for use

To play the game you must use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move either left or right. The player will endless move forward and your goal is
to get as far as possible.

You can also use the 'O' and 'P' keys to cyle through the music!

# How it works

As described before i have a list of prefabs for obstacles. These obstacles include other cars and general road obstructions such cones.
These path tiles will start with a set amount spawned at the beginning of the game. These paths will continue to be spawned in front of where the player is going.
Once this happens a previous path will be removed behind the player to save on resources.

# References

For this project there are two main asset packs I bought and used to help with want I wanted to achieve.
The two asset packs are: 

- [Low Poly Ultimate Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/low-poly-ultimate-pack-54733)

The low poly asset pack was used for general props and prefabs. The prefabs used were: the player, the obstacles and the scenery buildings

- [THOR Thunderstorm](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/thor-thunderstorm-103956)

The thunderstorm package was used as extra background for when 'ACDC - Thunderstruck' plays.


For this project I also used some music:

-[From Hell - Dance with the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNMDZS1Ab0A)

-[Get Out - Dance with the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E9-rDplPrM)

-[Thunderstruck - ACDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM)

-[Go! - Dance with the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umevclxiv2o)

-[Electric Groove - Lazerhawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gvsAfVXS48)


# What I am most proud of in the assignment

What I am most proud of in this assignment is the variety / replayability. I think that there is already enough groundwork of variation in my project,
between the obstacles and scenery.

My project is setup in a way that it would be easy enough to add more obstacles and scenery too!
